\section{Introduction}
    \tab Moths serve as indicator species for biodiversity. To assess ecological health, 
    Mariana Abarca and her lab collect insect samples using light-based traps at Macleish. 
    However, these traps can disorient insects and interfere with their natural behaviors. 
    To minimize this disruption, the lab wants to know the peak time of insect activity 
    so that traps can be deployed brieflyâ€”a few dozen minutes a day, if possible. \newline
    \tab In an ideal scenario, traps would be set when moth activity is highest. However, due to the 
    lack of annotations on the Macleish image dataset, it's not possible to confidently determine 
    when most moths land. Instead, this project uses the total number of detected insects 
    as a proxy.  Detected insects were still classified as moths or non-moths using a model fine-tuned on 
    external, 
    labeled crops of insects from trap images.  Classifier predictions were logged to enable manual evaluation 
    of predictions by Mariana and her lab so they can give insights on model weaknesses.
    Additionally, due to the model's excellent performance on the proxy traps dataset,
    there is proof-of-concept that a model can reliably detect moths 
    on the Macleish images if given sufficient labels to train on.
    \newline

    \end{figure}
    \tab Because the Macleish dataset is relatively small,  
    if 
    the images were to be manually labelled in the future to aid with classification
    and model validation,
    a key question is whether there's enough to train a reliable moth detection model. 
    To investigate this, the moth classifier was also trained on a smaller subset 
    of the external insect trap dataset to compare performance outcomes. \newline
Overall, the following questions were answered:
 \begin{itemize} 
    \item Is a smaller dataset with a higher percentage of the minority class, moths,
    sufficient for the classifier to correctly identify moths?
    \item Around what time the Macleish traps are active are most insects detected, on average? 
    % \item Upon visual inspection of EfficientNet classifications, does the model
    % appear to make reasonable predictions at pass @ 5? PROB DELETE
\end{itemize} 
    \section{Datasets}
    \textbf{AMI-GBIF Binary Dataset:} It consists of 14105 crops of moths,
    and 37105 crops of non-moths, manually annotated and
     collected from traps all over the world (Jain et al, 2024).
    A trap dataset would be more transferrable to predicting on Macleish images
     than a dataset of insects in the wild,
    as traps have white or neutral backgrounds that won't add as much noise to model predictions.
    In order to answer the first question about data composition to model performance, the 
    overall datset was
    partitioned into two train datasets: Limited and Full (Table 1).
    There is a shared test set with 
    a 50/50 split between moths and non-moths to test the model's ability to distinguish 
    between
    classes despite the class imbalance.

    \textbf{Macleish Insect Trap Images:} There are 1290 unannotated images of 
    insects on traps in 2024 from June 14 to October 21. Each day has images taken roughly every 10 minutes from around
    21:00:00 to 23:58:04. The traps have different sizes as indicated in the image 
    names (``syd" is large,
    ``car" is small, and ``ama" is medium) but since some trap sizes are less represented than others,
     no analysis is done on predicted detections by trap size. 
     While the ratio of moths to non-moths is not 
     known, moths are expected as the minority class, as typically seen in traps. 
    \section{Methods}

    \textbf{EfficientNet-B0 Fine-Tuning:} EfficientNet was used not only for computational efficiency,
    but also because it is very effective for fine-tuning tasks
    on relatively small image datasets like the AMI-GBIF binary crops (Tan \& Le, 2019). 
    Weights are loaded
    from the pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model, all unfrozen, and the final classifier layer
    is reshaped to output size 2 for binary classification (Figure 1). \newline
   \tab A total of two models are fine-tuned on the Limited and Full datasets, with the same hyperparameters,
    and named as ``Limited" and ``Full" respectively. A cosine annealing learning rate
    and Adam optimizer is used. Loss function is cross entropy.
    In order to batch the binary image crop dataset,
     images are resized to 90 x 110 pixels, 
    the mean height x width of 100 randomly sampled images. This is a major limitation, however,
    since there's huge deviation in image crop size (Figure S1), so information is lost during resizing. 
    Experiments reveal EfficientNet Full 
    performance suffers when images are not reshaped during inference, 
    as it has learned to distinguish classes via the 90 x 110 sizing (Figure S2). 
    \newline
    \textbf{GroundingDINO Bounding Box Labelling:} 
    GroundingDINO is a state-of-the-art open-set object detection model (Liu et al,
    2024).
    IDEA Research's base GroundingDINO model is used, its detection prompt set
    to``insect" with a score threshold of 0.2, and  bounding box coordinates around detections are logged alongside detection scores.
    The bounding box crops are transformed to size 90 x 100 pixels, the size of images the EfficientNet model is
    originally trained on.
    Subsequently, EfficientNet Full 
    (which has slightly better performance than Efficientnet Limited) 
    classifies the crops via pass @ 5, where
    the model predicts the class of the bounding box five times and the majority class
    (chosen at least 3 times) is used as the label (Figure 1).  
    \newline
    \textbf{Compute Resources:} Training and inference is done on a single A100 GPU 
    with 30G of memory. It takes up to 4 hours to fine-tune an EfficientNet model with
    batch size 500 on all of AMI-GBIF binary dataset.
    Meanwhile, it takes around 12 hours to retrieve GroundingDINO bounding boxes and 
    EfficientNet predictions on all Macleish images. 
    \nobreak  
    \section{Results}
    EfficientNet trained on the Full dataset outperforms EfficientNet on the Limited dataset
    throughout the board, and therefore will be used for Macleish insect crop classifications. 
    Despite the Full dataset having a lower portion of moths (the minority class) (Table 1),
    it shows fewer instances of false positives and false negatives (Figure S3) by the end of training. (The positive class is 
    considered non-moths.)  This indicates
    that a larger dataset could improve accuracy even with a smaller share of the minority moth class. Therefore, if Macleish 
    were to have labelled insects, a small portion of moths (around a quarter and above) may not warrant the need for
    sampling algorithms to increase exposure of a classifier to moths.

        EfficientNet Full    & \textbf{96.4\%} & \textbf{0.95  }    & \textbf{0.98}   & \textbf{0.98}  & \textbf{0.055} \\
        \midrule 
        \end{tabular*}
    \end{table}
    \newline \tab Additionally, EfficientNet Limited only does marginally worse than 
    EfficientNet full with a 2\% reduction in accuracy (Table 2) despite being trained on a bit over half 
    the full dataset. A smaller, well-balanced dataset may be sufficient for training a reliable moth detection model.
    Therefore, annotated Macleish images would be a promising training set despite it being smaller than most image trap datasets. Even though GroundingDINO 
     only picked up around 10k detections overall, that is a significant number of image crops that could supplement training data
        for a new classifier meant to be better suited to Macleish trap images.
    \newline

    \end{figure}

    \tab GroundingDINO, upon manual evaluation, captures insects 
    of different sizes and occassionally misses a very small insect or boxes equipment. While there is no metric on how well
    it fares on detecting insects from Macleish, its number of detections is considered a good proxy for insect activity.
    The detection statistics reveal that there is a peak in insect prescence around time 
    23:20:00 (the images in this cohort are taken at 23:20:03 or 23:20:04), with on average 10.04 insects detected around that time
    (Figure 2). The single specific time in which most insects were classified as moths was 23:50:04 (Figure S4), with around 10 moths predicted per image. 
    However, there were only 3 images
    taken at that time, hence it could be skewed by chance. The number of insects classified as moths seems to be 
    relatively high and stable around 23:10:00 to 23:40:00 (Figure S4). However, the lack of ground truth labels doesn't allow a confident
    answer to when most moths are actually present. Regardless, Mariana and her lab can likely limit insect trap usage to a smaller
    timespan after 11 pm, as the number of insects detected is considerably lower before 11 pm.
    \section{Discussion} 
    \tab The paper contributes a pipeline for annotating images at Macleish: a fine-tuned model that 
     excels in identifying moths from other insects on a separate insect trap dataset, alongside
    another pre-existing model that can retrieve bounding boxes of insects. Combined, these models are used to get 
    statistics on insect detections at Macleish, and classifications on detections for for manual evaluation. More importantly,
    experiments indicate a proof-of-concept that a classifier can reliably identify moths from even a smaller insect crops dataset. This means 
     Macleish images annotations would be a significant supplement moving forward for training a more relevant classifier. 
     And finally, it's discovered that moth traps could be limited to activation at times after 11 pm,
    as that's when most insects were detected. \newline
    \tab The major limitation of this project is 
    the lack of any labelled data on Macleish images. This prevents future
    steps in this project. While insect trap datasets can be similar to Macleish images, Macleish images are unique
    due to the colored lighting the edges of its traps have.
     This paper's moth classifier seems to ambiguously classify insects on image crops saturated by blue
     lighting from the trap. Even among pass @ 5 and pass @ 1 runs, the model detects some crops as moths despite such crops not looking like
     moths (Figure S2 is an example). The pipeline would be significantly improved with annotated Macleish images, ideally with bounding box coordinates. 
     Once that is done, GroundingDINO can be 
     fine-tuned on those coordinates and the classifier would have its AMI-GBIF binary dataset supplemented by Macleish image crops. 
     One assumption that could be formally validated, then, is whether pass @ 5 really does yield better classification accuracy than pass @ 1,
     as pass @ 5 was used due to the assumption that it would be more reliable.
